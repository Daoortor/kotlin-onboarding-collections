Hello! Welcome to the third module of the Kotlin onboarding course.
This module will introduce you to definitions of **collections** in the Kotlin language 
and will teach ypu hoe to work with them.
We assume that you have completed the first and second parts of the course
or are familiar with all topics they cover.

All topics will be accompanied by links to [the official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html),
which you can read later.

Each lesson of the course is built in the form of a project:
step by step, by completing different small tasks,
you will get a fully working project in the end.
At the end of each lesson, an additional project will be offered:
it includes all the topics of the lesson but does not contain any theory materials.
The topic of this module is **TODO**.
It means that in each lesson, you will create a web application with 
something familiar from your or your parents' childhood.
Note, part of the code will be prewritten by the course author
to avoid going deep into web programming in this course.

### Project description

The main goal of this project is to implement a shop window with rubber duckies 
and study `List`, `Set`, and `Map` collections.
