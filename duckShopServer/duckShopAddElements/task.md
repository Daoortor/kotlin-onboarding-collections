In this task you need to implement functions to be able to
add ducks to the Duck Shop.

### Task

Implement three versions of the `addRandomDuck` function from the `GameChangeFunctionsService` class in
the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.course.duck.shop.functions.change` package.
These functions should add a random duck from a list, set, or a map.

Note, you need _actually_ to add a new duck, it means for the cases with a set and a map you 
need to generate a duck that is not present in the collection and add it.

After implementing this task the `Add` button in all three modes becomes alive:

**TODO: add a gif**

If you have any difficulties, **hints will help you solve this task**.
