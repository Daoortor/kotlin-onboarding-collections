Kotlin has a reach standard library with the majority of different functions. 
Usually, if you need to do something with your collection, you don't need to implement it since this 
function already exists in the standard library. The functions can perform different things - 
from obvious ones like find or handle something to very complex ones like sort your collection or perform aggregation operations.

You can find all functions in the [official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/).

In the rest of the steps in this project you will find tasks to implement something with the collections,
in the **Hints** section you will find the built-in functions that can do it. Let's try to find the necessary functions in the official documentation and only then check your guess with the hints.
The ability to search for something in the documentation is also a very important skill for programmers.
