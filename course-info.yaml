title: "Kotlin Onboarding: Collections"
language: English
summary: "
<p>This course is designed for novices in Kotlin and focuses on working with collections in the Kotlin language.
This is the third module of the course, the <a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21067-kotlin-onboarding--introduction\">first</a> and <a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21913-kotlin-onboarding-object-oriented-programming\">second</a> modules can be found on JetBrains Marketplace.
This module assumes that you are already familiar with all the constructs discussed in the first and second parts.</p>

<p>Each lesson of the course is built in the form of a project: step by step, by completing different small tasks,
you will get a fully working project in the end. Some of the projects are practice-based and introduce to you
different helpful Kotlin functions though practical exercises without much theory part.</p>

<p><i>Note that this course does not provide a detailed explanation of such aspects as asymptotic complexity, 
mostly, it just describes the definitions of different types of collections and shows how to use them in Kotlin.</i></p>

<p>All topics will be accompanied by links to <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html\">the official Kotlin documentation</a>, 
which you can read later. Some of the topics covered in the course are listed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>definitions of <tt>List</tt>, <tt>Set</tt>, and <tt>Map</tt> collections;</li>
  <li>read-only and mutable collections with <tt>add</tt> and <tt>remove</tt> operations;</li>
  <li>built-in functions to work with <tt>List</tt>, <tt>Set</tt>, and <tt>Map</tt>;</li>
  <li>FIFO (First-In-First-Out) approach and how to work with in Kotlin;</li>
  <li>LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) approach and how to work with in Kotlin;</li>
  <li><b>[will be available later]</b> aggregation operations;</li>
  <li><b>[will be available later]</b> sequences.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>After this course, you will be ready to use Kotlin collections in efficient ways.</i></p>
