In this task you need to implement the `addCommand` function in the already implemented `GameService` 
class in the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.course.tamagotchi.game` package.

This function should add the `command` into `commands` if `commands` has less than `MAX_CAPACITY` elements.
The function returns if the `command` has been added.
