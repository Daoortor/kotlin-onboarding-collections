Congratulations! You did a great job and created a working application.
We have put together a few ideas on how you can further improve this project by yourself.
These improvements will not be tested within the course.
Some improvements require changes to both the client (what is displayed in the browser)
and the server (the application logic).
We don't cover the client-server architecture in this course,
so you can either explore that on your own or implement ideas that don't require investigating third-party code.

**Server improvements:**

- You can add another character to the game with more different actions.
- You can add more complex logic to scale changes, e.g. generate different types of 
food that influence scales in different ways.
- Currently, we lose the application state if we turn off the server.
  You can implement the ability to save the current state of the applications in files,
  and when the server is starting, you can extract this data.


**Client improvements:**

- Adding new characters requires not only server, but client improvements - you need 
to upload new pictures, icons, handle new actions, etc.
- You can make alive the application via adding animations for all actions.
