Congratulations! You did a great job and created a working application.
We have put together a few ideas on how you can further improve this project by yourself.
These improvements will not be tested within the course.
Some improvements require changes to both the client (what is displayed in the browser)
and the server (the application logic).
We don't cover the client-server architecture in this course,
so you can either explore that on your own or implement ideas that don't require investigating third-party code.

**Server improvements:**

- You can add more complex logic for group by or searching operations.
- You can add an ability to upload your own photo.
- Currently, we lose the application state if we turn off the server.
  You can implement the ability to save the current state of the applications in files,
  and when the server is starting, you can extract this data.


**Client improvements:**

- You can make alive the application via adding animations for all actions.
- To make uploading new photo easier, you can add a special button for it.
